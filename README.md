# PCA-genome-data
Genomic data clustering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project was done in collaboration with [Ray Iyer](www.linkedin.com/in/%7Eiyer). The data for this problem is a real dataset which comes from the [1000 genomes project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/). I thank Prof. Gregory Valiant for providing this dataset.

## Data 
Each of the 995 lines in the text file represents an individual.  The first three columns represent respectively the individual’s unique identifier, his/her sex (1=male, 2=female) and the population he or she belongs to Each of the 995 lines in the file represents an individual. The first threecolumns represent respectively the individual’s unique identifier,  his/her sex (1=male,  2=female) and the population he or she belongs to[^ftnote]. The subsequent 10101 columns of each line are a subsample of nucleobases from the individual’s genome.
